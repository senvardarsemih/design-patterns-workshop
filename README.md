## Behavioral Patterns

### Strategy Pattern
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.

### Visitor Pattern
Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any existing code.

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
